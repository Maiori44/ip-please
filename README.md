# ip-please
(Game submission for [LÃ–VE Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/love2d-jam-2023))

You are the admin of a private server.
Many people want to join, your job is to let them in.
Hackers may try to infiltrate, do not let them in.
Trolls will try to join with high ages, deny them. (Also, deny anyone younger than 14)
Lastly, the server may glitch, you have to prevent that.
Allowing and denying users correctly will grant you points.
Messing up may lead to the end of the server.
Good luck!
